# offshore-digital-twin-framework

Project Status: Literature Review & Conceptual Framework

Objective: Designing a physics-informed digital twin for offshore mechanical assets to predict fatigue life under stochastic wave loading.

## Research Questions:

How can Bayesian updating be used to refine degradation curves with sparse sensor data?

Can Transfer Learning adapt models from naval vessels (Shipyard data) to stationary offshore platforms?
